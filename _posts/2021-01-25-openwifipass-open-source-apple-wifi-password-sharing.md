As part of our [USENIX Security â€™21](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21) paper **Disrupting Continuity of Apple's Wireless Ecosystem Security: New Tracking, DoS, and MitM Attacks on iOS and macOS Through Bluetooth Low Energy, AWDL, and Wi-Fi**, we reverse engineered [Apple's Wi-Fi Password Sharing](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209368).
Our open source Python implementation *OpenWifiPass* is now available at [GitHub](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openwifipass).
