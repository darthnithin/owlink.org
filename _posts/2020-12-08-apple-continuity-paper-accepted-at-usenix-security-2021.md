We reverse-engineered and analyzed more parts of Apple's wireless ecosystem (*Continuity*). The resulting paper **Disrupting Continuity of Apple's Wireless Ecosystem Security: New Tracking, DoS, and MitM Attacks on iOS and macOS Through Bluetooth Low Energy, AWDL, and Wi-Fi** just got accepted at [USENIX Security ’21](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21). We'll post updates once the paper is published.
