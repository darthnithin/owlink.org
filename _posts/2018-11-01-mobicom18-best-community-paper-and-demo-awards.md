Today, we received the [**MobiCom ’18 Best Community Paper Award**](https://sigmobile.org/mobicom/2018/keynotes.php) for our paper *One Billion Apples’ Secret Sauce: Recipe for the Apple Wireless Direct Link Ad hoc Protocol*. The award recognizes "intellectually exciting ideas, combined with a substantive contribution in computer code, experimental data, or other artifacts deemed useful to the research community at large."
In addition, we received the [**MobiCom ’18 Best Demo Award**](https://sigmobile.org/mobicom/2018/demos.php) (one of two) for the accompanying demo *Linux Goes Apple Picking: Cross-Platform Ad hoc Communication with Apple Wireless Direct Link*.
We thank the juries for the awards and hope that our work can be useful for others.
