Welcome to the **Open Wireless Link (OWL)** project. We are researchers from the [Secure Mobile Networking Lab](https://www.seemoo.tu-darmstadt.de) at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de) looking into Apple's wireless ecosystem. Our goal is to assess security and privacy as well as enable cross-platform compatibility for next-generation wireless applications. We started by investigating the [Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL)](/wiki/#what-is-apple-wireless-direct-link-awdl) protocol and will go beyond.
You can read our [publications](/publications/) and use our [open source code projects](/code/). If you have questions or would like to collaborate, feel free to [contact us](/contact/).
